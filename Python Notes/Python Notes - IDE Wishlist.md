# Python Notes

## IDE Wishlist

I wanted to keep track of things I like or don't like about various text editors/IDEs that I have used to write Python.

### Like:
* Being able to jump to a function/class/etc. definition
* Being able to find all references/usages of a function/class/etc.
* Autocomplete

### Dislike:
* Version Control in an IDE
* Fucking automatically writing the second bracket/quotation mark
