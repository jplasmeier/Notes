# Building foobnix from Source

On a virgin GNU/Linux installation (elementaryOS)

02/11/2017

* Install virtualenv, make an env, activate the env
* `sudo python setup.py install`
* `pip install gi`
* `sudo apt install python-gi`
* `pip install mutagen`
* `sudo apt install python-gobject`

This didn't work. It's a webkit error and I can't find a fix.
