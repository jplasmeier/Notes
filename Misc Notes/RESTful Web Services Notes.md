# RESTful Web Services Notes

Notes taken while reading RESTFul Web Services by Leonard Richardson and Sam Ruby.

## Chapter 1: The Programmable Web and Its Inhabitants

### Glossary

A lot of terms are coincident, so this will try to delineate them. 

* **RESTful Web Service**: Method info in HTTP method
* **Resource-Oriented Architecture**: Scoping info in URI
* **RPC-Style Architecture**: Method and scoping info inside "envelope"

### REST vs RPC-Style

RPC Style web services define their own vocabulary for using it, in constrast to REST which has a standard vocabulary (GET, POST, DELETE, etc.) matching the HTTP method. 

SOAP web services are almost always this style.
