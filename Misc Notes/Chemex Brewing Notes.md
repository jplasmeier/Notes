# Chemex Brewing Notes

##### 01/21/2017

10 sec grind*, medium-coarse, Seattle beans

_* first grind of the machine, so probably was less than 10 sec adjusted_

Water @ ~200F

Poured to bottom of knob (bloom + 2-3 pours)

Taste was thin but tasty. More strength via more grinds?

10 sec grind, medium-coarse, Seattle beans

Water @ ~200F, maybe a little above

Poured to just under knob (bloom + 3-4 pours)

Taste was a bit strong. So, the taste varies a surprising amount over minor changes in grounds and water. I'm not exactly sure how much less grounds came out the first time, though.
